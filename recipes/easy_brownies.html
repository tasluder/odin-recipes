    <h1>Easy Brownies</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The first time I made brownies without my mother was in the late 1960s, using a recipe from Paula Peck, the cookbook writer. Over the years, I tinkered with that and a similar version by Marion Cunningham. As my daughters learned to cook, they experimented a bit further. But we never really strayed from the originals. As long as you keep the flour to a minimum and don't add chemical leavening like baking powder, you will produce a true and beautiful brownie.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ounces unsweetened chocolate</li>
        <li>8 tablespoons (1 stick) salted or unsalted butter, more for greasing pan</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>pinch of salt if you use unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 350 degrees. Combine chocolate and butter in a small saucepan over very low heat, stirring occasionally. When chocolate is just about melted, remove from heat, and continue to stir until mixture is smooth. Meanwhile, grease an 8-inch-square baking pan. If you like, also line it with waxed or parchment paper and grease that.</li>
        <li>Transfer mixture to a bowl, and stir in sugar. Beat in eggs, one at a time. Add flour (and salt and vanilla if you are using them), and stir to incorporate. Stop stirring when no traces of flour remain.</li>
        <li>Pour into pan, and bake 20 to 30 minutes, or until set and barely firm in the middle. Cool on a rack before cutting.</li>
    </ol>
